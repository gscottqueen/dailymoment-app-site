    <p><i>Everyone has anxiety.</i> ðŸ˜¬</p>
    <p>That is the first thing you will learn when you begin sharing with friends and family the challenges you are facing. Each person has their own advice for how to overcome. Some will send you inspiring audio clips and meditation apps. Others will share their schedule of exercise and diets. Take a long walk in the woods! Also, drugsâ€¦lots of drugs.</p>
    <p>Like many, I tried it all.</p>
    <p>To be honest...it works...most of the time...sometimes...well, usuallyÂ .ðŸ˜¢ But who wants to be on pills the rest of their life? Or listen to some dude tell you how to meditate with a fancy accent for $5.99  a month? Maybe your not an athletic person. Maybe that audio clip is bull shit. And you would be right!</p>
    <p>We don't <i>need</i> any of that.</p>
    <p>But there is <strong>one fundamental thing we absolutely need to continue on with it all and conquer anxietyâ€¦a moment to breathe</strong></p>
    <p>Here is how I understand it.</p>
    <div style={breakStyle}>---</div>
    <img src={breatheGif} style={imgStyle}/>
    <figcaption style={captionStyles}>Take one deep breathâ€¦hold it for a momentâ€¦now let itÂ out...</figcaption>
    <div style={breakStyle}>---</div>
    <p>Consider how that feels. When you think about it, <i>our typical breathing pattern is barely noticeable</i>. Our bodies tend to be machines of efficiency. They are designed to only take in what's needed to sustain.</p>
    <p>Those who experience extreme cases of anxiety will tell you that breathing and drowning at the same time is more likely than you think.</p>
    <p>When our anxiety peaks into panic, one of the strangest things that occurs, is that we begin gasping for air! The stress on our mind is literally creating the same physical reaction as drowning. Our minds are not made for long, sustained periods of stress, so our body does exactly what it has evolved to doâ€Š-â€Šover hundreds and thousands of yearsâ€Š-â€Š<strong>fight or flight</strong>.</p>
    <p>We are more powerful than we accept.</p>
    <p>Both responses require an extraordinary amount of energy. The more air we let in the more explosive that energy can become. The problem is, sometimes there is no one to fight and nowhere to run. Our body becomes over run with emotion, often erupting outside of our reach.</p>
    <p>The secret to beating anxiety, is to just get started.</p>
    <p>This may not be the only thing you have to do, but it is a great place to start and to keep integrated into your daily routine. If you truly focus, one breath at a time on being in the moment, you will unlock that potential.</p>
